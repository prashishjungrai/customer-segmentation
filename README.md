This project applies unsupervised machine learning to perform customer segmentation for a bank. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups and assess their creditworthiness, informing risk management and targeted marketing.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handled data skewness and outliers, then scaled numerical features to prepare them for clustering.

Clustering Methods: Compared three clustering algorithms to find the best approach for the dataset:

K-Means: Used for segmenting customers based on numerical features like Age, Credit amount and Duration.

Hierarchical Clustering: Explored as an alternative to K-Means to identify clusters based on data hierarchy.

K-Prototypes: used to cluster all featuresâ€”both numerical and categorical
providing a more comprehensive segmentation.

Result Analysis: Analyzed the clusters to understand the unique characteristics of each customer segment, revealing valuable insights for credit decisions and marketing strategies.

Technologies:Python,Pandas,NumPy,Scikit-learn,K-Prototypes,Matplotlib,Seaborn
